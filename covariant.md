- is a vector "partner" to a vector in standarts vector space 
- "represents the component" 
- is like the **row of a matrix** $1 \times n$ 
- Notation from JvD: $$e^i$$

# covariant transformation in dual basis
$$x_j \to x'_j = x_i (T^{-1})^i_j$$
	always transforms with $T^{-1}$ -> transforms **with the basis**
