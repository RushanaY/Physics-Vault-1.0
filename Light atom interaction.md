notes from lecture 10+11, with structure from the given Skript others are yet to be added

We have: 
- a [[Two niveau system]] 
- **momochromatic Lightfield** of frequency $\omega_L = 2 \pi \times v_L$ 
	- => their interaction described by$$H = H_{at} + V(t)$$
	- in our case: 
		- particle with [[dipol moment]] has the **interaction energy** $$V = \vec d \cdot E$$
		- external, oscillating **electrical field** of the light field $$\vec E (\vec r, t)$$
		=> using the **Dipol approximation** we get the **Light atom interaction [[operator]]**  


--------------------------------
1. optic bloch 
2. stationary solutions of a two niveau system
3. dynamic aof a bloch vector on a b. sphere 

different level have different enregies -> frequencies 
dipol approximation :
- energy jump corresponds to a spesific wave length 
- in cse when wavelenth is biggger than the energy gap of theis niveau system 
- threfore we assume: diregard the atom , only see the two energy elvels 
- atoms have circular field, but we approximate them to a straight, linesr line (is a guess)
- the E field is constant in R, but changes with time
- we don't care about the E field of the atom, it is toosmall. look directly at the exited electrons 
- atom does not have an electric field! (J.): 
	- atom usually described by hamiltonian 
	- but atom is being hit by such a big wave, 
	- the ewave is so much bigger, that when it huts, it transfers the same amount if energy in the whole atom. It doesn't matter if it hit in the edge or in the middle. All szstems and niveaus get the same energy
- dipolmatrix $< 1|\vec d |2>$ (maybe a tensor, definetly a tensor)
	- we only look at what we can prove experimentally
- RWA  
	- Rabi frequency: the osciallation of the probability of the elctron between two states  
- Pulsfleache 
	- we need to transform the Bloch vector (transform, rotate)
	- basically polarisation 
		- the probabilities oscillate (just like components of licht beam from optics)
		- analogy to understand it better:
			- transformation by $\pi$ changes from right diagonal to left diaginal polarization. Callin the two different diagonal pol. as states whoes us how to transform between two states 
			- => that's what we call it coherent
			- if we change by $\pi/2$ it gies to circular polarisation
			- => we change between cherent and incoherent 
	- ????????????????
- Verstimmung -> if the incoming light doesn't have the perfect needed frequency for the state change. But there is still the change, other wise we would observe far to little cases of exitement, if we would have hoped for the perfect income




**Second try**

Hamilton operator of the Interaction of light and atom: $$H = H_{at} + V(t)$$
	$H_{at}$ - free atom -> approximated to a [[2 niveau system]] 
	$V(t)$ - **interaction energy of light and the atom** $$V= - \vec d \cdot E$$
		E - external electrical field of the light 
			- in our case: **oscillating** field $\vec E(\vec r, t )$ of the light field 
			- using [[dipol approximation]] we get $$\vec E (\vec r, t ) \sim \vec E (\vec R,t) 
			\sim \vec E(t)$$and therefore: $$V =  \hat d  \cdot \vec E (t) $$ 
				with [[Dipol operator]]
