# nucleus
- Aufbau 
- characteristics 
- cool numbers (mass, charge)

# electron hull 
- charecteristics 
- numbers (mass, charge)
- Energies -> potential energy 


# atom 
- stability at certain temeratures 
- quanten pressure 
- stability -> [[Bohr radius]] derivation 

### atomic spectrums 
- absorbtion and emission 
- changing of energy states and levels 

#### electrostatic interaction 
-> between nucleus and electron from the hull 
- [[Fine structure constant]] derived 

#### Multi electron systems 
- Spin orbit ineraction 
	- relativistic effect
	- shift of the enrgy ? 
- magnetic moment 

#### Hyper fine structure
