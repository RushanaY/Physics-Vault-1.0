There are **differentiable curves** in the space: $$\vec c(s) = (c_x(s) , c_y (s) , c_z (s) )$$
	so that every point on the curve is the same as the derivative at this point $$\frac{d}{ds} \vec c{s} = 
	\vec G (\vec c(s))$$
	-> no field lines cann therefore cross eachother (otherwise the derivative would not be definite (*eindeutig*)) 
	- this curve defines a [[flux]] of the field: **transportatin of an amount along the field lines with the velocity of $\vec G$** 

Using the [[Divergence theorem]] we know: 
- From $\vec \triangledown \cdot \vec E = 0$ we know that ==Dencity of field lines is poroporional to the field strength== 
	explanation:
	- choose surface S small enough, so that the field can be considered as constant
	- this surface is a starting point of a good amount of field lines --> forms some sort of a tube 
	- look at a plane, that is orthogonal to the surface and look how the tube looks there 
	- because of the divergence theorem, we know that the Flux has to be the same at both the surface and the randomly chosen plane
		- -> the line dencity is inversly porpotional to the surface ,just like field strenght -> field strength is proportional to the field line dencity
