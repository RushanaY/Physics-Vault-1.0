= **Absorbtion + scattering** of star light in dust clouds 

- looking directly through the interstellar cloud ([[ISM]]) at the star the observer can see the **Redening**. The reason for that is, that all the blue light get's scatterd away. Red light is long and is therefore less prone to be scatterd 
- looking at **90Â°** to the cloud, the observer can see all the scatterd away light, that is **blue**

Formulas: 
	- **Colour Excess** $$E_{B-V} = (B-V)_{intrinsic} - (B-V)_{observed} = 1.085 (\tau_B - \tau_v)$$
		- small $E_{B-V}$ -> not much ISM there 
	- **magnitude change** $$m_{V, beob} = m_V + A_V = m_V = 1.085 \tau_V$$
		- with: $A_V = 2.5$, $\log_{10} (e) \tau_V = 1.085 \tau_V$  
	- $R_V = \frac{A_V}{E_{B-V}} = \frac{\tau_V}{\tau_B - \tau_V}$
