**Definition**: $$\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle : V \times V \to F$$
	*This is a map, that takes in two vectors and gives a number**
	is also called the [[general scalar product]]* 

**Properties**:
- **Symmetry** $$\langle \hat v, \hat w \rangle =   \langle \hat w, \hat v \rangle$$
	The order of the components doesn't change the result
- **Linearity** $$\langle a \hat v,  \rangle = a \langle
 x, z \rangle + b \langle y, z \rangle$$ $$$$

 - **positvie defintness**  $$\langle x,x \rangle > 0$$
	a product of a number with itself can't be negative

Vs has "scalar porduct" - multiplication of number with vector , multirpling eith a number 
inner product - ist a map that takes to wvectirs and gives out a number. basically a tensor. is one level about ve the vector space 
more specific " dot product", sosecuak case of immter porduct. Hilbert space is a VS with vectir product. Example of that is EUclidian iVD. In this case inner porduct is here a dot product 



inner product make vector smalle

Inner product = general scalar product is also a map:
$$g: V \times V \to \mathbb{R}, \space (\vec v, \vec w) \to g(\vec v, \vec w)$$

- takes in two vectors and gives a number 
- defines a metric tensor (in orthonormal basis it's trivial -> $\delta_{ij}$) 
	-> $g_{ij} = \langle \hat v_i , \hat v_j \rangle_V$ 
	-> $\langle \vec x, \vec y \rangle_{\mathbb{R}^n} \equiv x^i g_{ij} y^j$
	- 
- most general case
- is the defining characteristic of a Hilbert space
	- if a space has an inner product -> **inner product space** or **normed vector space** 

in orthonormal basis is inner product and standard scalar product the same thing 
-> the problem lies in the covariant and contravariant vectors that are being used 





Scalar product "of a vector space" = standard scalar product of $\mathbb{R}^n$ is a map:
$$\langle, \rangle : V \times V \to \mathbb{R}, \space (\hat v, \hat w ) \to \langle \hat v , \hat w \rangle$$
- covariant notation $$\langle \vec v, \vec w \rangle = v^i w_i = v_iw^i$$ 
- is inside of a vector space 
- also known as
	- scalar product
	- dot product
- takes two vectors and gives a number 
- Properties:
	- symmetry
	- linearity
	- positive definitnes
- Things to do -> all part of Euclidian geometry, it's defining property
	- norm
	- length
	- angles
	- orthogonality
	- Cauchy Schwarz inequality
	- law of cosines 
	- normalization
	- projectin $$v_{II} = \hat w \langle \hat w, \hat v \rangle$$$$v_{senkrecht} = \vec - \hat w \langle \hat w, \hat v \rangle$$
- used in: 
	- orthonormalization of a basis 
- relation on covariant and contravariant vectors:
	- in standard scalar product they are the same thing

Generalized scalar product:
$\langle \vec x, \vec y \rangle_{\mathbb{R}^n} \equiv x^i g_{ij} y^j$  



I\ll text you if I fi
