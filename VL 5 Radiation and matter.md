# Lecture notes 

1. Electromagnetic radiation 
2. Defintion of radiation 
	- we look at photons as 
		- **particles** with different velocities, directions -> Difference: **no collisions** 
		- bigger actions -> **[[Hydrodynamic]]** and **[[Thermodynamic]]**
			- temperature, velocity of the current all have an analogue in looking at radiation 
			- -> with no collissions all flow directions are possible (think about the radial direction of a point source)
3. Describtion of radiation with the definition in mind 
	- [[spectral radiance]] (spektrale Strahlungsdichte) or specific [[intensity]] $$I_v = \frac{energy}{time \times area \times frequency \times solid \space angle}$$where [[solid angle]] is Raumwinkel
		- **Intencity per frequency**$$[I_v] = \frac{erg}{s \space cm^2 \space Hz \space sr}$$
		- **Intencity per wavelength** $$[I_{lambda}] = \frac{erg}{s \space cm^2 \space cm \space sr}$$where [[erg]] is the unit of energy and [[sr]]  the unit of the angle
		=> together. I guess they are the same on a very small scale: $$I_{\nu} d \nu = I_{\lambda} d \lambda$$
		- **Mean value of intencity** -> has the same units as I from Intencity$$J_{\nu } = \frac{1}{4 \pi} \int I_{\nu} d \Omega$$
		- **Radiation pressure** $$P_{\nu} = \frac{1}{c} \oint I_{nu} cos^2 \theta d \Omega$$

# Notes from book
more understanding than formulas

Stellar Atmospheres:
- concept: sun are light sources that have a layer of gas around them, that is stopping the light from coming through and gives it also particular chatecteristics
