$$\hat a = \frac{\vec a}{||\vec a ||}$$
- is perpendicular to the surface or what ever 
- difference to the [[unit vector]]: normal vector doesn't have to be length 1
- is a pseudovector, that **characetrizes** the surface $$\vec a = \vec u \times \vec v$$
	- is a specialty of the 3 dim space (in general dimensions -> use a tensor on a [[hyper plane]] element)
