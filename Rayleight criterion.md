For **circular aperture** (circular hole/slit):
# $$\theta \approx 1.22 \frac{\lambda}{D}$$$\lambda$ - Wavelength, D - diameter of the lens , $\theta$ - angular resolution in [[radians]]

Comment: 
- the angle is the distance between the first **Minima** and **Maxima**  

# visual help
The top image is the correct and clear view of two! seperate light sources. Making the resolution angle smaller, the two point sources are harder to see as two different points, instead of one blurry source. 
Ideally: two point sources are clearly seperate:
