1. **homogenous maxwell equations and wave functions in vacuum**
	**Derivation of the [[wave function for E field]]**
		![[Derivation of the wave function]]
	if one wants to derive the same for the B field, you take the same cross product, but with $\vec B$ 




2. **Homogenous complex Maxwell equations and Hilbert space** 

	1. **show conservation of energy**
		use this cool Trick ![[Tricks#Partition of an integral in smaller parts]]
		so using that do show $\frac{dU}{dt} = 0$ : $$\frac{dU}{dt} = \int (E \frac{\partial E }{\partial t} + c^2 B \frac{\partial B}{\partial t}) dV = c^2 \int E (\triangledown \times B ) - B(\triangledown \times E) dV = 0$$
			The $dt$ can be put inside of the integral and we use the [[sum rule]]. 


	2. **Derivation of Maxwell equations from the [[Riemann Silberstein vector]]** 
	$$\triangledown \vec F = 0$$$$\partial_t \vec F = -ic \triangledown \times \vec F$$
		instead of four equations, only two are needed
		Intresting:  analogous behaviour has the [[Hamilton equation]] and [[Schroedinger equation]] 

	3. **to show that linear [[operator]] are [[hermetic]] in [[Hilbert space]]**
