going by the ![[principle of least actions]]  
Comments:
- for every coordinate there will be a seperate equation 

- [[Mass is sliding , without friction, on a table, that is tilted at an angle]] 
	$$L = \frac{m}{2} = (\frac{\dot x^2}{cos^2 \alpha} + \dot y^2) - mgx \space tan\alpha$$

- [[In Schwerpunktsystem with Relativkoordinaten]]  
$$L = \frac{M}{2} \dot R^2 + \frac{m}{2} \sum_a \dot R^2_a - U$$
