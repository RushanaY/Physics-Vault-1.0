Here will be the homework sheets from the lectures in T1 from Muchanov. It shoudl be only a guide to what basis knowlege was needed in the particular homework sheets. This here is only a guide through the homework 

**Sheet 1**
1. [[Differential types|Differential]]  
2. derivation of the [[differential in spherical coordinates]]  
3. show that the Euler Lagrandge Funktion is invariant under small changes 
4. Movement of a particle (also velocity and coverd distance) 
	- ($x(t), y(t), z(t)$ are given and you put them into the vector $\vec r(t)$) 
5. Lagrangefunction ([[Mass is sliding , without friction, on a table, that is tilted at an angle|masss point on table]]) 

**Sheet 2** 
1. potential energy as a homogenious functon 
	1. rescaling of $U(\alpha x_i) = \alpha^k U(x_i)$ -> *important*??????
	2. show for kinetic energy T$$2T = \frac{d}{dt} (\sum_i p_i r_i) - \sum_i r_i \dot p_i$$using: $2T = \sum_i v_i p_i = \sum_i v_i \frac{\partial T}{\partial v_i}$ 
	3. [[Time average]] 
	4. [[Viral theorem]] 
2. Conservation of componetns of momentum and tork
3. Lagrangefunction 
4. show that the central of mass is in the middle of the connecting vecor of two masses 

**Sheet 3** 
1. [[Central potential]]
