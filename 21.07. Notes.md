ROtating frame tranform: ->   
- in dirac picture both state and operator have a time dependance (interaction picture) 
- is just like the schroedinger and heisenber pictures 
- Trafo SP: $| \psi ' \rangle = U | \psi \rangle$ 
- Trafo HP (changing the framework around the operator: use expectation value): $(\langle \psi| \hat O | \psi \rangle)' = \langle \psi ' | \hat O'| \psi' \rangle = \langle \psi| U^{\dagger} \hat O' U|\psi \rangle$ -> $\hat O' = U \hat O U^{\dagger}$  (were U comes frpm SP)
- Trafo in DP: 
	- using $H = H_0$ (Atom) $+ H_1(t)$(Laser) 
	- using the schroedingers equations we transform them compeletly
